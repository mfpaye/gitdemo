# DESCRIPTION:
# In this kata we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply represent the numbers in words.

# Examples:

# "one" => 1
# "twenty" => 20
# "two hundred forty-six" => 246
# "seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen" => 783919
# Additional Notes:

# The minimum number is "zero" (inclusively)
# The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)
# The "and" in e.g. "one hundred and twenty-four" is optional, in some cases it's present and in others it's not
# All tested numbers are valid, you don't need to validate them


# x = list(range(1,10))

# print(x)



# Write a Python program that:

# asks for first name as input (e.g. "James")
# asks for last name as input (e.g. "Bond")
# Then prints:

# "Your name is Bond, James"

# Note: The last name is printed first, followed by a comma, and then the first name.

x = ('heart', 'spade', 'diamond', 'club')
for i in x:
    print(len(i))

print(int(the_full_deck[0][:2]))


# first = input('Enter your first name:\n').lower().title()
# last = input('Enter your last name:\n').lower().title()

# print(f'Your name is {last}, {first}.')
